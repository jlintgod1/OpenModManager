For A Hat in Time

> [!NOTE]
> Some features will soon be merged with the regular OpenModManager, assuming that everything goes smoothly and I don't fail to communicate again(that's why it took a while for it to even happen lol.)
> Additionally, further development on this fork will be limited due to me being busy with numerous things in my life.

What the peck? A fork of a flying boat?

That's m_cube/mcu8's Open Mod Manager(OMM) but with additional features like:
 - Better AlwaysLoaded functionality!
 - Auto Workshop Blocker
 - (Slightly untested and source code only) Automatic Screenshot Uploader(so Steam doesn't complain about your .bmp and large .jpg files) 
 - Slightly better formatting and bug fixes
 - Jlintgod (the Spider) and his "humor"
 - Sketchy code!

Precompiled Binaries are now available on the [Releases](https://github.com/jlintgod1/OpenModManager/releases/latest) tab!

Requires the Steam release of A Hat in Time and its modding tools, a 64-bit operating system, and .NET Framework v4.8, unlike the original OpenModManager

Installation
---
> [!WARNING]
> The "latest release" is relatively out of date, with it lacking the Automatic Screenshot Uploader and User Experience tag, along with it having a bug that prevents a mod icon from being selected. New binaries will come out TBD.

Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/jlintgod1/OpenModManager/releases/latest) tab, extract it into a folder and run the "ModdingTools.exe" executable. If Windows Smartscreen blocks the executable from running, click "Run Anyway." (If you don't see it, click "More Info.")

Building
---
> [!NOTE]
> If using Create-Release-Files.ps1, you will need to edit the file if you are not using Visual Studio 2022, so that it properly detects your installation of VS.

Clone the repository and open it in the Visual Studio 2019 (or newer), or run Create-Release-Files.bat/.ps1 to compile with VS.
