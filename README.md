(sorry no actual screenshot yet)

## What the peck? A fork of a flying boat?

That's m_cube/mcu8's Open Mod Manager(OMM) but with additional features like:
 - Better AlwaysLoaded functionality!
 - Auto Workshop Blocker
 - Slightly better formatting and bug fixes
 - Jlintgod (the Spider) and his "humor"
 - Sketchy code!

---
Requires the Steam release of A Hat in Time and its modding tools, a 64-bit operating system, and .NET Framework v4.0, just like with the original OpenModManager

Installation
---
A pre-compiled binary is not available yet due to a lack of significant changes, but you may build it yourself(instructions below.)

Building
---
Clone the repository and open it in the Visual Studio 2019 (or newer) or run Create-Release-Files.bat/.ps1(you will have to edit the file if you aren't using VS 2022.)
