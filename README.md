That's m_cube/mcu8's Open Mod Manager(OMM) but with additional features like:
 - Better AlwaysLoaded functionality!
 - Auto Workshop Blocker
 - Slightly better formatting and bug fixes
 - Jlintgod (the Spider) and his "humor"
 - Sketchy code!

Precompiled Binaries are now available on the [Releases](https://github.com/jlintgod1/OpenModManager/releases/latest) tab!
---
Requires the Steam release of A Hat in Time and its modding tools, a 64-bit operating system, and .NET Framework v4.0, just like with the original OpenModManager

Installation
---
Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/jlintgod1/OpenModManager/releases/latest) tab, extract it into a folder and run the "ModdingTools.exe" executable. If Windows Smartscreen blocks the executable from running, click "Run Anyway." (If you don't see it, click "More Info.")

Building
---
Clone the repository and open it in the Visual Studio 2019 (or newer) or run Create-Release-Files.bat/.ps1(you will have to edit the file if you aren't using VS 2022.)
